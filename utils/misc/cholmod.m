function [R, indef, E] = cholmod(A)
% CHOLMOD Modified Cholesky factorization
%  R = cholmod(A) returns the upper Cholesky factor of A (same as CHOL)
%  if A is (sufficiently) positive definite, and otherwise returns a 
%  modified factor R with diagonal enries >= sqrt(delta) and
%  offdiagonal entries <= beta in absolute value,
%  where delta and beta are defined in terms of size of diagonal and
%  offdiagonal entries of A and the machine precision; see below.
%  The idea is to ensure that E = A - R'*R is reasonably small if A is 
%  not too far from being indefinite.  If A is sparse, so is R.
%  The output parameter indef is set to 0 if A is sufficiently positive
%  definite and to 1 if the factorization is modified.
%
%  The point of modified Cholesky is to avoid computing eigenvalues, 
%  but for dense matrices, MODCHOL takes longer than calling the built-in 
%  EIG, because of the cost of interpreting the code, even though it
%  only has one loop and uses vector operations.
